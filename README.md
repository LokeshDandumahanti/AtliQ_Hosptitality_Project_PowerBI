# AtliQ_Hosptitality_Project_PowerBI

# What is this all about?
This project analyses the data of 8 different hotel brands having 4 different room types in 4 different locations with 8 booking websites. 

# Objectives

1. Give the business insights on how to improve revenue and reduce loss.
2. Give future insights on expansion and consolidation

## 1. Revenue Realised

In this we have analysed the actual money received by the hotels after deducting the cancellation refund from the revenue generated

## 2. Loss realised

In this we have analysed the money lost due to cancellation refund. We will assume that cancellation of hotels is inherently bad for the business in long term as it loses its popularity in market, even though its free money is received in short term.
